**Intersection of Software + Law + Bureaucracy**

### eRegulations

A Platform to Read Regulations

Standardized how Regulations are written to be readable across multiple government agencies.

Also wrote documentation on regulations themselves.

Asking Questions + writing precisely + iterating = .... (missed the slide end)

### Draft federal source code policy

Drafted a policy to share with all agencies to open-source at least 20% of code and share code with other agencies

Put issues on GitHub



### Other

 Missed the slide


Public Service + open source + documentation = of the people, by the people, for the people

Software is a core part of how government works - "It would be in the constitution if the founding fathers knew about it"

**Copyright does not apply to US government works**

 - It's hard to read contribute or reuse code that isn't well documented


### What If

More people felt like participants in their government

+ huge tons of skilled people wanted to work for or contract for the government.
